* As a user I want to see a picture that represents the time of the day.
* As a user I want to have a button that saves the current website link, so I can find it quickly in the extension.
* As a user I want to see the links that I save in a list.
* As a user I want to be able to remove the link from my list.
* As a user I want to be able to mark the link as “checked”, so If I want to keep it in my list I can see that I have gone over it already.
